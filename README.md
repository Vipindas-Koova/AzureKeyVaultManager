# Project set up and deployment

1. azure-pipelines.yml file in the project can be used to automate deployment. You can use Azure devops yml pipeline for deployment

3. If your repo is in Github, you need to add a service connection in azure devops project settings that points to your subscription and resource group (in which you have    created storage account and function app). Please copy the connection name
3. Following properties needs to be modified in azure-pipelines.yml:<br />
 a azureSubscription = "Service Connection Name that you created previously"<br />
 b functionAppName = "Name of function app you created in the above subscription"<br />
 c. storage = "Name of storage account"<br />
 d. configuration.baseApiUrl = "URI of your function app"<br />
 e. configuration.authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId of your function app}"<br />
 f. configuration.redirectUri = "URI of your static app"<br />
 
# Notes:
